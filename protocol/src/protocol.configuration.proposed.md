#### Configuration Request

The `workspace/configuration` request is sent from the server to the client to fetch configuration settings from the client. The request can fetch n configuration settings in one roundtrip. The order of the returned configuration settings correspond to the order of the passed `ConfigurationItems` (e.g. the first item in the response is the result for the first configuration item in the params).

A `ConfigurationItem` consist of the configuration section to ask for and an additional scope URI. The configuration section ask for is defined by the server and doesn't necessarily need to correspond to the configuration store used be the client. So a server might ask for a configuration `cpp.formatterOptions` but the client stores the configuration in a XML store layout differently. It is up to the client to do the necessary conversion. If a scope URI is provided the client should return the setting scoped to the provided resource. If the client for example uses [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to manage its settings the configuration should be returned for the passed resource URI. If the client can't provide a configuration setting for a given scope then `null` need to be present in the returned array.

_Client Capability_:

The client sets the following client capability if it is able to handle `workspace/configuration` requests:

```ts
/**
 * The workspace client capabilities
 */
workspace: {
	/**
	 * The client supports `workspace/configuration` requests.
	 */
	configuration?: boolean;
}
```

_Request_:

* method: 'workspace/configuration'
* params: `ConfigurationParams` defined as follows

```ts
export interface ConfigurationParams {
	items: ConfigurationItem[];
}

export interface ConfigurationItem {
	/**
	 * The scope to get the configuration section for.
	 */
	scopeUri?: string;

	/**
	 * The configuration section asked for.
	 */
	section?: string;
}
```

_Response_:
* result: any[]
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the 'workspace/configuration' request
